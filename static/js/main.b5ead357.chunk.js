When considering what it means to be conscious, there are many philosophical and physical arguments that come into play. In Chapter 5 of Until the End of Time, Greene references an example of seeing a red Ferrari \u2013 our perception of seeing a red Ferrari is merely light waves travelling through the air, hitting the back of our eyes, and triggering chemical changes in our brain that we perceive as red (Greene 2020, Chapter 5). Extending this further, perhaps our decisions are made by chemical changes and biological processes as a result of stimuli. This concept can be extended out of just consciousness, however, and we can look at the way that physics work on a more general level: any movement in the universe, any change, can be predicted/reduced to the product of some other physical action. At least in classical physics, given the forces acting upon a given particle, we can predict what will happen to that particle (Greene 2020, Chapter 3). Whilst quantum uncertainty complicates this (as will be addressed later in this explanation), overall, changes/movement is just the product of other movement.
