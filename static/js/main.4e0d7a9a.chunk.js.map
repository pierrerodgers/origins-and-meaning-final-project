You go to your cupboard to take out your favourite COLOR sweatshirt — the one you got at the concert downtown a few weeks ago. It's not there! You remember the stain you got on it the other day, no time to wash it just yet. Anyway, you have options. No need to stress. Do you wear your red sweater, or your navy blue hoodie?\",\n    options:[\n      {\n        text:\"Red sweater\",\n        next:13\n      },\n      {\n        text:\"Navy blue hoodie\",\n        next:13\n      }\n    ],\n    replace:{\n      target:\"COLOR\",\n      with:[\"green\", \"orange\"],\n      frequency:0.35\n    },\n    peek : \"What colour is the sweatshirt in the wash? 35% of the time it'll be green, 65% of the time it'll be orange.\"\n  },\n  {\n    title : \"Time to head downtown for dinner\",\n\t\tdetails: \"You rush onto Broadway and run to the 116th 1 station. No trouble swiping your Metrocard, you rush down to the platform — 'Shit! 10 minutes!'. You sit down on one of the seats, pull out your AirPods, and start listening to your favourite podcast — it's this podcast that was turned into a TV show, The Midnight Gospel. You're listening, and the host is talking so prophetically about questions of mortality and life and meaning that you get whisked away into your thoughts, so immersed in this other world that you don't even realise your feet have taken you into the subway car, that you've sat down, that you're on your way to dinner.\\nAll you can think about is this podcast — life, what does it all mean? What does our paltry existence in this world matter if we will all die in the end? The universe will die, knowledge will be lost, pretty much everything will be gone, all remnants of memory and thought — even the very thought of your existence will die out! You're so wrapped up in this existential crisis that you aren't really aware of yourself as you climb the subway stairs out up to the sidewalk and step onto the road and your noise cancelling headphones are blocking out the sound of the outside world but they're not loud enough to shut out the blare of the horn of the car that slams into you.

When considering what it means to be conscious, there are many philosophical and physical arguments that come into play. In Chapter 5 of Until the End of Time, Greene references an example of seeing a red Ferrari – our perception of seeing a red Ferrari is merely light waves travelling through the air, hitting the back of our eyes, and triggering chemical changes in our brain that we perceive as red (Greene 2020, Chapter 5). Extending this further, perhaps our decisions are made by chemical changes and biological processes as a result of stimuli. This concept can be extended out of just consciousness, however, and we can look at the way that physics work on a more general level: any movement in the universe, any change, can be predicted/reduced to the product of some other physical action. At least in classical physics, given the forces acting upon a given particle, we can predict what will happen to that particle (Greene 2020, Chapter 3). Whilst quantum uncertainty complicates this (as will be addressed later in this explanation), overall, changes/movement is just the product of other movement. </p><p id=\"b8269bba-17d3-4f24-81ed-1594f406a4a6\" class=\"\">\n        </p><p id=\"f311a100-ebe8-4f45-802d-751cb96f5d69\" class=\"\">If our minds are merely physical objects made up of molecules and atoms that follow the rules of physics, then <strong>what is it to be conscious?</strong> Is our conception of consciousness just us living out the process of stimuli and input and our brains reacting to that input? And what does that mean for free will? If our own physical movements are just the result of physics, then what does that mean for free will? Are we also <strong>living a pre-ordained path in the way that we ‘choose’ to act?</strong></p><p id=\"78fcc17c-c329-4ac0-a786-a21bf36f0411\" class=\"\">\n        </p><p id=\"50fdace0-681f-422d-a9cd-1bfea7103481\" class=\"\">The ending in this game is the same each time, no matter how many times you run the story through, you still reach the same place. Therefore – what does it mean to have free will? <strong>Is the illusion of free will (as you have through the story) enough</strong>? Does that make the experience worthwhile? If we extend this analogy to our real lives, maybe the illusion of free will in our own lives is strong enough to make it worthwhile or meaningful?</p><h2 id=\"0e15e572-91aa-4183-b114-1ceb3dc420ba\" class=\"\">Quantum uncertainty</h2><p id=\"07bbe368-a6b4-4eb0-80bb-2e6c5cc49082\" class=\"\">The game is centred around the player leaving a lecture about quantum uncertainty, and the way that the act of observation can determine certain particle&#x27;s states. Atoms can assume certain states based on whether or not they are observed/interacted with, and the state of a certain atom or molecule can be predicted or explained using a probability function (Greene 2000, Chapter 5). <strong>What if this concept were extended to a larger scale in real life? </strong></p><p id=\"4f7bd054-a458-460b-a5a8-80e95d5e2d0a\" class=\"\">\n        </p><p id=\"6624b84a-be91-43dd-97bd-bd923e020e5c\" class=\"\">Scattered through the game are certain small elements that change every time you play the game. For example, if you go up to ask the professor a question, sometimes your shoelace will be untied, and sometimes it will be tied; <strong>the probability that your shoelace is untied is 80%</strong>. If you play the game enough times, this trend will emerge (it&#x27;s been hard coded into the game). There are also other little easter eggs scattered through the game. For example, who do you run into when if you leave the lecture hall instead of asking a question? Is there a probability function that emerges? <strong>Check out the lightbulb hints for more on each page.</strong></p><p id=\"3c38aea2-193f-442d-a4bf-63d09da6439e\" class=\"\">\n        </p><p id=\"5457f12f-f2fb-4c61-afcc-f9639b073239\" class=\"\">This mirrors the concept of the particular uncertainties only being decided upon observation; the appearance of certain things follow probability functions just as the location of an electron is unclear until observation. On a larger scale, these concepts are easier to visualise and comprehend.</p><p id=\"593c73cb-0dfc-4a6d-b83b-10c04454d151\" class=\"\">\n        </p><h2 id=\"38cd2ce9-7e39-4f3f-84e0-f0d6e9f71bec\" class=\"\">Quantum entanglement</h2><p id=\"f3a54819-8951-4d1c-b621-e7b5ec94db25\" class=\"\">Similar to the inclusion of uncertainty and probability fields, quantum entanglement is incorporated into the story – albeit at a larger scale than it actually plays out in reality. In the game, if you go to John Jay Dining Hall, and go to the main room, you&#x27;ll find that the salt is empty; inversely, if you go to the King&#x27;s Table dining area, the pepper is empty. This mirrors the way that on a quantum level, the spin (or other attributes) of particular electrons, photons, etc. can determine the spin of another particle elsewhere in the universe (Greene 2005, Chapter 4).</p><p id=\"61afb8e1-a173-42d9-ba72-462d6081473a\" class=\"\">\n        </p><h2 id=\"e69d0588-e0c6-4af9-98b8-0cd38e5972de\" class=\"\">Mortality</h2><p id=\"5a6870e9-4de0-4ca4-bd81-66cc3a03fec5\" class=\"\">This class has forced students to reckon with and comprehend the reality of mortality, not only on a personal level, but also the death of the universe. As Greene speaks about in <em>Until the End of Time</em>, &quot;[m]ost of us, in the service of sanity, don&#x27;t fixate on the end&quot; (Greene 2020, Chapter 1). How do we respond when our mortality is centred in our experience, when we are reminded of the fact that we will die, no matter what we do. But it&#x27;s not just our own mortality that will occur, but the death of the universe, of thought itself (Greene 2020, Chapter 9). How do we respond to the certainty of mortality and death? What happens when such mortality is unavoidable, despite our choices? Once again, is the illusion or suppression of reality enough?</p><p id=\"09102cca-e53c-442e-8429-dfcbbc6b7032\" class=\"\">\n        </p><h3 id=\"6ea7e6a7-5b30-4c06-8bd2-5a51740355a9\" class=\"\">Sources</h3><p id=\"846d227b-241d-49bc-86ad-ddbdb3c670dc\" class=\"\">Green, Brian. <em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em>.
