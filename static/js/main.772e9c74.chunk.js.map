And just like that, it all ends.\",\n    options:[\n      {\n        text:\"Restart\",\n        next:0\n      }\n    ],\n    peek : \"This is where some extra info would go about any of the scientific concepts visible on the page.\"\n  },\n]\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(0);\n\n  const updatePage = function(page) {\n    setCurrentPage(page);\n    console.log(\"Page updated\");\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Container>\n      <Page className=\"mb-44\" page={pages[currentPage]} updatePage={updatePage}/>\n      <Row>\n        <Col>\n          <Peek text = {pages[currentPage].peek}/>\n        </Col>\n        \n      </Row>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Page(props) {\n  /*\n    props:\n      title : String\n      details : String\n      options : String\n  */\n  let pageDetails;\n  if (\"replace\" in props.page) {\n    const details = props.page.details;\n    const random = Math.random();\n    const idx = (random < props.page.replace.frequency) ? 0 : 1;\n    pageDetails = details.replaceAll(props.page.replace.target, props.page.replace.with[idx]);\n  }\n  else {\n    pageDetails = props.page.details;\n  }\n  \n  return (\n    <Col>\n      <Row className=\"mb4\">\n        <h1>\n          {props.page.title}\n        </h1>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row>\n        <p className=\"display-linebreak\">\n          {pageDetails}\n        </p>\n      </Row>\n\n      <Row className=\"mb-4\">\n        {props.page.options.map((option) => {\n            return(\n            <Col>\n              <Button variant = \"outline-primary\" key={option} onClick={() => {props.updatePage(option.next)}}>\n                {option.text}\n              </Button>\n            </Col>)\n          })}\n      </Row>\n      </Col>\n\n    \n  )\n}\n\nfunction Peek(props) {\n  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false);\n  \n  useEffect( () => {\n    setIsVisible(false);\n  }, [props.text])\n\n  if (isVisible) return (\n    <Alert variant=\"info\">\n      <h2 onClick = {() => {\n      setIsVisible(false)\n      }}>\n        💡\n      </h2>\n      <p>\n        {props.text}\n      </p>\n    </Alert>\n  )\n\n  return(\n    \n    <div onClick = {() => {\n      setIsVisible(true)\n    }}>\n      <h2>\n      💡\n      </h2>\n      <p>\n        Click the lightbulb for more\n      </p>\n    </div>\n\n\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
